#
# File for shared configuration of python-essentials scripts
# 
# The file is in the format used by the `configparser` python module. Its documentation is provided at https://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html and isn't repeated here.
# 
# python-essentials scripts search configuration files at the following locations in the given order:
# 
#   * ~/.python-essentials.cfg
#   * /etc/python-essentials.cfg
#   * [PATH_TO_PYTHON_ESSENTIALS_SCRIPT]/python-essentials.cfg
# 
# The first file which is found is set to be the configuration file for python-essentials scripts, other eventually existing files are ignored. If reading the set configuration file fails due to missing read permissions for the file for the user invoking the script, other eventually existing files are not tried to be loaded and the script fails with an appropriate error message.
